# Code-Refactor-Challenge

First course challenge, refactoring code for greater accessibility. The purpose of this refactor was to make the code with semantic html to make it more easily accessible for assisting technologies and tools for those who are visually impaired or otherwise unable to use the webpage normally. 
By making it more easily readable for a device like a phone or computer, we avoid confusion that these people may encounter otherwise.
Along the way refactoring this webpage I learned the importance of separating code into various concepts, using varied elements to represent them, such as the article, section, aside, and figure elements. Using these elements not only makes the page more accessible, but easier to read for other developers, and more easily displays what is happening inside the code itself.

## Installation

For general webpage access, now with improved semantic html for better accessibility.
